			<p> Hello! My name is Manuel, and this is my webpage. If you would like an explanation about the layout then you can skip to the next paragraph, otherwise, I will explain a little bit about myself. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science back in 2020, and before that I got my Associates degree in Social Science. I wasn't always into programming, heck I didn't even know it existed till I got my first mentorship working as an I.T. assistant in my local City Hall. Computers back then seemed to be mystical objects that allowed anyone to do things, but thanks to my professors along with the countless number of books, videos, and web articlese I was able to become the programmer I am today, and that is why I am here. Besides putting my portfolio and projects on the website, my main goal is to offer my knowledge to the next generation of computer scientist in hopes that it will better the future. My ideology is that knowledge should be free and open for those who seek it. I also believe in positively encouring and helping those who want to learn the subject no matter their skill level. That being said, I can't wait to show you what you can learn! </p>
			<p> To begin, this is the home page. In its current state, it functions as an overview for the rest of the website. For those who have business inquiries, you may click on the “About”, “Contact”, and “Project” pages. The “About” page has my current resume that you may look at. If you wish to contact me through email, phone number, or other social media then you can find all the information in the “Contact” page. Besides business, if you with wish to learn then the “Documentation” page is there for you. Documentation includes my personal footnotes along with step-by-step explanation and tips on languages I know, along with other disciplines in computer science. Hope this is helpful, and if you find any issues please contact me so I may address them.  </p>
