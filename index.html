			<p>Hello! My name is Manuel, and this is my webpage. If you would like an explanation about the layout then 
				you can skip to the next paragraph, otherwise, I will explain a little bit about myself. I graduated in 2020 
				with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, and before that I received my Associates Degree in Social Science. 
				I was not always into programming; I did not even know it existed till I got my first mentorship working as an I.T. 
				assistant in my local City Hall. When I was young, I thought computers were mystical objects that allowed anyone to do anything, 
				but thanks to my professors along with the countless number of books, videos, and articles I was able to become the programmer I am today, 
				and that is why I am here.  Besides putting my portfolio and projects on the website, my main goal is to 
				offer my knowledge to the next generation of computer scientist in hopes that it will better the future. 
				One of my main ideology is that knowledge should be free and open for those who seek it. I also believe in 
				encouraging and helping those who want to learn the subject, no matter their skill level. That being said, 
				I can’t wait to show you what you can learn!
			</p>
			<p> To begin, this is the home page. In its current state, it functions as an overview for the rest of the website. 
				For those who have business inquiries, you may click on the “About”, “Contact”, and “Project” pages. The 
				“About” page has my current resume that you may look at. If you wish to contact me through email, phone number, 
				or other social media then you can find all the information in the “Contact” page. Besides business, if you wish
				 to learn then the “Documentation” page is there for you. Documentation includes my personal footnotes along with 
				 step-by-step explanation and tips on languages I know, along with other disciplines in computer science. Hope this
				  is helpful, and if you find any issues please contact me so I may address them.  
			</p>
