         <h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/Type_of_editors_on_windows.png" class="medium align_right" alt="" />
            If you already have your environment set up you may skip this
            section, otherwise keep reading. To write your own code
            you will need a text editor, which like the name states, is an 
            application that helps the user edit text. Luckily, all operating 
            systems (OS) come with one! For example, Windows has Notepad, MacOS 
            has TextEdit, and Linux usually has Vim. Now I say "usually" 
            since there are multiple distributors that preload the Linux OS 
            with their own choice of editor, but you will most likely encounter Vim, 
            especially if you use Ubuntu. There are also third-party editors 
            that come with extra features. The one I am currently using is 
            Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. Make sure to find the one that is right for
            you, otherwise you may look at the Intro to Operating Systems
            lesson to learn how to use Vim. It's great to write your code somewhere, 
            but like all programs, you need a place to run it. That's where the 
            terminal comes in!
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/PowerShell_LinuxTerm_cmd.png" class="medium align_left"/>
            The terminal is a nifty place that is the bridge between you
            and your computer. It can take user input, run other programs,
            manage files, display output, and much more. For those 
            who are using the MacOS or the Linux OS,
            you already have access to the terminal. As for Windows users
            we have command-line (cmd) and Windows PowerShell. Right now,
            would be a good time to point out the controversies behind the 
            naming scheme and their definitions. There is a difference between,
            terminal, shell, and command-line, though they act so similarly 
            that most people often interchange the names. For the sake of uniformity,
            we will use Linux terminal to write, compile, and run our programs.
            I highly recommend Window users to follow the installation and
            configuration guide for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Microsoft's 
            website. What WSL does is partition a section of your computer
            for Linux and is extremely useful. If you don't want to
            install WSL, you can still use cmd and Notepad to write,
            compile, and run your code. We are almost close to 
            creating our environment, but we need one more thing.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            We have the terminal, now all we need are the tools
            to interpret our code. A
            compiler is software that translates our high-level language,
            in this case C++, into low level language such as Assembly which is machine 
            code. It is easy to install one within the terminal, and I will show you in 
            both the Intro to OS lecture and towards the end of this lecture.
         </p>

            Remember how I said you need an editor and a terminal
            to write code, well that's not entirely true. There are applications
            known as integrated development environments (IDE)s that come with
            the same equipment that editors and terminals have, and then some.
            Almost all the big ones, like Microsoft's Visual Studio - not to
            get confused with Microsoft's Visual Studio Code which is just 
            the editor - are free to use but come with a catch. Basically, you
            can only use them for studying purposes, and can't make a profit
            unless you buy the business versions, while text editors and
            terminals are open source (FREE!) and you can do whatever you please.
            Companies like free, people like free, so it's best to follow
            the practices.

         <h2>The Basic Structure of Any Code</h2>
         <code class="example" id="HelloWorld">
            1 #include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
            2 using namespace std; <br />
            3 <br />
            4 int main() <br />
            5 {<br />
            6 cout << "Hello World!"\n;<br />
            7 return 0;<br />
            8 }<br />
         </code>
         <h3>Reading each line of code</h3>
         <p>
            C++ is case-sensitive, for example, the key
            term <i>return</i> is different from the word Return. It also has a
            free-form layout, so space and line breaks are ignored during
            compilation. I know what you're thinking, if that's the case
            why can't I write, for example, "s t d" instead of "std" well
            the compiler ignores the spaces not the key words. Still, you
            can write each symbol, keyword, integer, and string - when we
            mean string we're saying a collection of characters - on 
            their own line and it will still compile like the code above. 
            The code above consist of multiple statements that we will 
            examine.
         </p>
         <h4>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</h4>
         <p>
            On line 1 there is the #include directive, which tells the
            compiler to look at the contents of the iostream file that is 
            within the less-than operator (&lt;) and greater-than operator (&gt;). You will learn more about 
            the file in the string manipulation section. For now, just know
            that it deals with input and output instructions. 
         </p>
         <h4>using namespace std;</h4>
         <p>
            Line 2 tells the compiler to use the default name space to
            identify terms such as <i>cout</i> which is part of the iostream 
            file. As you will learn, you can 
            override the functionality of key terms in your
            program by calling a different name space, but since we're learning, 
            we will use the standard.
         </p>
         <h4>int main()</h4>
         <p>
            Let's look at the following statement on line 4, main() is a
            function for the program. Each function carries out an 
            algorithm - also known as a process - which consist of 
            code. The parenthesis is where we can store parameters - 
            additional instructions for the function to run -
            though since this is a simple program we
            can just leave it empty. You will learn more about functions in
            future sections. The keyword <i>int</i> is called a data type, this specific data 
            type says that the main function can return an integer.
         </p>
         <h4>{ ... }</h4>
         <p>
            Both lines 5 and 8 help identify where the content of the
            main function begins and ends. This is one of the many locations 
            where you will put majority of your code in.
         </p>
         <h4>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!"\n;</h4>
         <p>
            To send output to the terminal, you need the
            term <i>cout</i>, followed by the two less-than-arrows operator &lt;&lt;. The part "Hello 
            World!" is considered a string and is defined by the
            quotation marks "" surrounding the characters. This helps
            the compiler distinguish code from plain text it must read. The 
            escape sequence \n is considered one character to the
            compiler, and it tells the compiler to break and start on
            a new line in the terminal. The semicolon is like a period
            and symbolizes the end of a statement. 
         </p>
         <h4>return 0;</h4>
         <p>
            Remember how I said the main function expects an integer to be returned,
            well this is it. On line 7 the compiler says to return 0,
            this means that there were no errors in the program and that it 
            can be terminated. However, if there are errors, the terminal
            will give you a long list of what seems like random words at first,
            but it is actually important information for fixing your code.  
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Errors</h2>
         <p>
            There are two types of errors in programming, syntax
            errors and logical errors. The first type is usually
            easy to fix because the compiler usually catches it
            for you. This could happen when you accidentally
            forget the semicolon or forget an operator. Logical
            errors on the other hand can be a little tricky.
            It's when the program still runs, but it doesn't do 
            what you ask it to. Compilers can't find these errors,
            but a debugger can help you go step by step till you
            find where you went wrong. 
         </p>

         <h2>Before Going into Programming</h2>
         <p>
            You probably want to run your first program right away. 
            That's great, and I want you to keep that ambition, but 
            there are some prerequisites that will make the process 
            easier. Not to say that you can't program 
            right away, humans are smart and can adapt, but it helps 
            when you know the fundamentals. Overall, this section 
            talks about knowing your system, knowing the terminal,
            and knowing math.
         </p>
         <p>
            First you must know how to navigate, use, and 
            troubleshoot the computer. If you're a complete 
            beginner when it comes to computers, then I highly
             recommend getting a book that's for the CompTIA A+ exam. 
             It teaches you about Windows, Linux, and MAC operating 
             systems - basically IT stuff that doesn't involve 
             programming. It also teaches you about the system's 
             hardware and how to troubleshoot. It might take a while 
             to read and comprehend, but it's well worth the time. 
             Nothing is more embarrassing than a Computer Scientist 
             who doesn't know how to update their drivers. Before 
             looking for books, first visit the CompTIA website to
             find the most recent test versions that' supported.
             Currently we're on test 1001 and 1002 which has plenty 
             of support, with 1101 and 1102 on the horizon - 
             currently doesn't have many books. Afterwards, you 
             can go to a retailer that provides the book for both; 
             usually the test are bundled together. If you 
             already know how to use your system, the next thing is 
             the terminal.
         </p>
         <p>
            The terminal appears to be a simple tool at first glance. 
            Might be an empty window with no text, might show some 
            text explaining that you need to update. Whatever the case 
            is, it's more complicated under the hood, and mastering it 
            is important. I highly recommend you 
            reading the Operating Systems section, but once again, you 
            can probably get by just knowing the fundamentals which we 
            will discuss later in this lecture. Besides 
            terminals, a computer scientist should have a solid 
            foundation in math. 
         </p>
         <p>
            An alarming amount of programming websites and YouTube 
            tutorials don't show this, but you need to have a background
            in math. Anyone can program, but a Computer 
            Scientist knows about time complexities and Big-O notation, 
            all of which involves mathematics. You can probably get away 
            with a couple of sections in these lectures without knowing 
            too much, but you need at least a good understanding in 
            calculus. Not to mention that you also need to learn about 
            discreet mathematics, combinatorics, and linear algebra for the more 
            complicated situations. Luckily all of this will be 
            mentioned in the math section of this website. You're 
            probably tired of hearing the word math, good thing we're 
            finally going to program. 
         </p>

         <h2>Preparing and Understanding Your Environment</h2>
         <p>
            In this section I assume that you have your terminal 
            opened and are ready for the next instructions. If you seem 
            to be having difficulties at any point, please refer to the 
            internet since I cannot anticipate every issue. For now, we 
            will be going over basic commands, updating the terminal, 
            and installing the compiler. 
         </p>
         <h3>Commands</h3>
         <p>
            Before writing our program it's essential to know how to 
            navigate our terminal. In this section we will be going 
            over fundamental commands. If you wish to know more visit
            the operating systems section, or research it online.
         </p>

         <h4>pwd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax"> 
            ~$ pwd
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/pwd_cmd.png" class="small"/> <br /> 
            Notifies which directory you're currently on.
         </p>

         <h4>ls Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ ls
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/ls_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Provides a preview of the subdirectories in the current directory you're in.
         </p>

         <h4>cd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ cd directory_name <br />
            ~$ cd .. <br />
            ~$ cd <br />
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/cd_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Helps navigate the directory. Can require additional
            input, for instance, if you want to move into a subdirectory 
            then you type and enter the subdirectory's name after the cd
            command. If you want to go back one directory you simply type two periods 
            after the cd command. Rather than using cd all the time, if you know the location of a 
            directory you want to visit, you can create a path by adding
            forward-slashes (/) to each step. Looking at the
            example, notice the path depicted
            in the green section, or notice the subdirectories
            when we enter the command ls.
         </p>

         <h4>mkdir Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ mkdir directory_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/mkdir_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Allows you to create a subdirectory in the current directory you're in.
         </p>

         <h4>vim Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ vim file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/vim_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/cpp_file_instance.png" class="small align_right" />
            Allows you to create and access the C++ file to edit.
            You need to learn additional modes and commands to edit, manipulate,
            save, and more. If you start typing right away, you might
            notice a letter or two missing, that's because we're not
            initially in insert mode. If you're not in 
            insert mode  shown at bottom of the window then press 
            the character (i) on your keyboard. To quit any of the several modes,
            press the escape key. You might forget you're not in insert
            mode and will try to delete characters by hitting backspace which 
            will cause the cursor to move to the left instead of
            deleting the letters. To fix this hit the (i) key again.
         </p>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/set_nmbr_cmd.png" class="small align_left"/>
            Vim comes with its own special commands that you can enter 
            in the command line located at the bottom of the window. Before typing a 
            command, exit out of any mode you're currently on.
            Once out of the modes, start your command with a colon (:). If 
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/override.png" class="small align_right"/> 
            you wish to know more simply enter (:help) on the command line to get more information,
            though we will go over a few of the basics. If you want line
            numbering all you have to do is enter (:set number) in the command line, really useful.
            If you want to save your file all you have to do is type (:w) in the 
            command line and press enter. If you want to quit use the following 
            command (:q). Note, sometime you can't quit before saving, so if you 
            want to force quit, all you have to do is enter (:q!). Warning, all
            progress will be loss, so the better option is to use the save and quit 
            command (:wq). 
         </p>
         <p>   
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/saved_file.png" class="small align_left"/>
            Remember, Vim is an open-source editor. It comes with some distributors
            of Linux like Ubuntu, but if you don't have it the terminal will complain 
            and suggest installing it using whatever command it gives you. Once again, 
            you can use any editor you like, but for educational purposes we will be 
            using Vim for the time being. 
         </p> 

         <h4>rmdir Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ rmdir directory_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/rmdir_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Allows you to remove a subdirectory in the current directory you're in. Warning,
            only allows you to remove empty directories. 
         </p>

         <h4>rm Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ rm file_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/rm_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Allows you to remove files.
         </p>

         <h4>sudo Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ sudo ...
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/sudo_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Gives you administrative access over operations. Note, it
            will often ask you for the password before doing its task, so
            make sure you remember the password. With this in 
            mind, we can move on to the next section.

         <h3>Updating</h3>
         <p>
            To avoid any issues when installing the compiler, it's always a good 
            idea to check for updates. To do this there are a set of instructions 
            you should follow. First, we must update the package list by entering
            the following command:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ sudo apt-get update
         </code>
         <p>
            The command "apt-get update" is part of APT (Advanced Package Tool)
            that helps manage software. In this case, we're trying to get the 
            updates so we can then upgrade and receive the proper packages. 
            Packages is just another way to say applications. To upgrade, 
            type the following in the terminal:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ sudo apt-get upgrade
         </code>
         <p>
            We're almost done, but we still need to make sure we upgrade critical
            packages while it cleans up unnecessary packages. Type the following:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
         </code>
         <p>
            If successful everything should be up to date and we can continue
            towards installing the compiler for our task.
         </p>

         <h3>Installing Compiler</h3>
         <p>
            The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is free software, more specifically, 
            it's a compiler that supports multiple languages and is compatible 
            with different types of hardware and operating systems. It has 
            matured since its origin and has given us the GNU C++ Compiler, also 
            known as g++, which allows us to compile both .c and .cpp files in terms of C++.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are two methods to download the package, but for this instance we will 
            use the build-essential route since it includes other key features like: 
            libraries, debuggers, and the compiler itself. To do this simply, 
            type the following:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ sudo apt install build-essential
         </code>
         <p>
            Afterwards, you can check to see if you have g++ by entering:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ g++ --version
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/gpp_version.png" class="medium" /> <br />
            If you see something similar to the image above then you have successfully 
            installed the package and are ready to write your first program. 
         </p>

         <h2>Writing, Compiling, and Running Code</h2>
         <p>
            We will walk through the steps as we begin the introduction of programming.
            We first need to set up a personal directory to store our programs, in this 
            case let's call it "Programs". 
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ mkdir Programs
         </code>
         <p>
            After creating our directory, let's access it with the cd command.
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ cd Programs
         </code>
         <p>
            Once inside our directory we can begin creating our programming files. 
            Use the vim command and call your file "HelloWorld.cpp".
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ vim HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Once the text editor opens remember to hit the (i) key to begin 
            insert mode. Type the Hello World <a href="#HelloWorld" class="lecture">example</a> from the beginning of the 
            lecture. Once completed you can save your progress by getting out of 
            insert mode and typing the save quick command (:wq). We can now begin the 
            compilation process.
         </p>
         <p>
            Like the terminal and the editor, g++ has its own unique commands.
            The first step is to translate our .cpp file into an object file; it's 
            a file with the extension .o attached to it. To clarify, the object 
            file contains machine level code which is something the system can 
            understand. To start the process type:
         </p>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ g++ -c file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ g++ -c HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Once the object file is created you can see it in your directory by 
            typing ls. Notice how it has the same name as the C++ file, this is 
            normal. In the case where you do get an error it will most likely be 
            a syntax error, which will identify the location of the error in the form 
            of text. Simply go back in and edit your file. 
            The next step is to name and create an executable file; for us 
            the executable file has a .out extension. This file will run our program 
            and provide output. Use the following example to create it:
         </p>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ g++ -o executable_file_name file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ g++ -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Typing the command ls will allow you to see the file. Notice how 
            there is no extension with this file. Finally, to run it 
            we use the dot-forward-slash (./) to denote the current directory with 
            the name of the executable file attached so we can access it like so:
         </p>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ ./executable_file_name
         </code>
         <code class="example">
            ~$ ./HelloWorld 
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/output.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Once you hit enter you should be able to see the output below, like 
            the example above. Congratulations you are officially a programmer!
