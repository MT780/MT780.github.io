         <h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/Type_of_editors_on_windows.png" class="medium align_right" alt="" />
            Those who have a solid foundation with editors, terminals, and compilers can skip this section. Otherwise, to write code, programmers need a text editor; an application that helps users write and edit text. Luckily, all operating systems (OS) come with one. For example, Windows has Notepad, MacOS has TextEdit, and Linux usually has Vim. Keyword "usually" since there are multiple distributors that preload the Linux OS with their own choice of editor, but most will encounter Vim, especially if using the most popular Linux distribution: Ubuntu. There are also free third-party editors that come with extra features, such as Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. For learning purposes and uniformity, later sections will describe how to use Vim. Before even using code, programmers need to communicate with the system. That's where the terminal comes in.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/PowerShell_LinuxTerm_cmd.png" class="medium align_left"/>
            The terminal is the bridge between the user and the computer. It can take user input, run other programs, manage files, display output, and much more. For MacOS and Linux OS users, the system has access to the terminal. As for Windows users, the system has command-line (cmd) and Windows PowerShell.  
         </p>
         <p>   
            Now would be a good time to point out the controversies behind the naming scheme and their definitions. There is a difference between terminal, shell, and command-line, though they act so similarly that most people often interchange the names. For the sake of uniformity, the following sections and lectures will use Linux terminal to write, compile, and run programs. It is highly recommend for Windows users to follow the installation and configuration guide for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Microsoft's website. WSL partitions a section of the system for Linux and is extremely useful. For those who don't want to install WSL, it is possible to use cmd and Notepad to write, compile, and run code.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            Besides the terminal, programmers need tools to interpret code. That tool is known as a compiler. A compiler is software that translates high-level language (like C++) into low level language (such as assembly) for the system to understand. It is easy to install one within the terminal, and later sections will explain the installation process.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/Visual_Studio_pic.png" class="medium align_right"/> 
            Technically, there are applications known as integrated development environments (IDE)s that come with the same equipment that editors and terminals have, and then some. Almost all the big ones, like Microsoft's Visual Studio - not to get confused with Microsoft's Visual Studio Code which is just the editor - are free to use but come with a catch. Basically, the software can only be used for studying purposes, and programmers can't make a profit unless they buy the business versions. While text editors and terminals are open source (FREE!). Companies like free, people like free, so it's best to follow the practices.

         <h2>The Basic Structure of Any Code</h2>
         <code class="example" id="HelloWorld">
            1 #include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
            2 using namespace std; <br />
            3 <br />
            4 int main() <br />
            5 {<br />
            6 cout << "Hello World!"\n;<br />
            7 return 0;<br />
            8 }<br />
         </code>
         <h3>Reading each line of code</h3>
         <p>
            C++ is case-sensitive. For example, the key term <i>return</i> is different from the word Return. It also has a free-form layout, so space and line breaks are ignored during compilation. Caution, compiler doesn't ignore the content between line breaks. For example, "s t d" is interpreted as the letters s, t, and d while "std" is interpreted as the keyword <i>std</i>. Still, a programmer can write each symbol, keyword, integer, and string - when we mean string we're saying a collection of characters - on their own line, and it will still compile like the code above. The code above consists of multiple statements that will be examined.
         </p>
         <h4>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</h4>
         <p>
            On line 1, there is the #include directive, which tells the compiler to look at the contents of the iostream header file that is within the less-than operator (&lt;) and greater-than operator (&gt;). The iostream file, along with other files, will be explained in the String Manipulation lecture. For now, know that it deals with input and output commands. 
         </p>
         <h4>using namespace std;</h4>
         <p>
            Line 2 tells the compiler to use the default name space to identify terms such as <i>cout</i>, which is part of the iostream file. It is possible to override the functionality of key terms in the program by calling a different name space, but due to learning circumstances, these lectures will use the standard.
         </p>
         <h4>int main()</h4>
         <p>
            Let's look at the following statement on line 4. The main() is a function for the program. Every program has a main function and can have additional functions. Each function carries out a process, which consist of code. The parentheses are where we can store parameters - additional instructions for the function to use - though since this is a simple program, it is left empty. Functions will be explained in future lectures. Finally, the keyword int is called a data type, this specific data type says that the main function can return an integer.
         </p>
         <h4>{ ... }</h4>
         <p>
            Both lines 5 and 8 help identify where the code of the main function begins and ends. This is one of the many locations where programmers will write their code..
         </p>
         <h4>cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!"\n;</h4>
         <p>
            The code above uses the term cout, followed by two less-than-arrows operator (&lt;&lt;) to send anything on the right side of the operator to the terminal. The part "Hello World!" is the content displayed in the terminal and is considered a string. Remember, a string is a set of characters surrounded by double quotation marks "". The double quotation marks help the compiler distinguish between code and text for the user to view. The escape sequence, newline (\n), is one character according to the compiler. It tells the compiler to break from the existing line, and to start on a new line in the terminal. The semicolon is like a period and symbolizes the end of a statement.
         </p>
         <h4>return 0;</h4>
         <p>
            Remember how I said the main function expects an integer to be returned, well this is it. On line 7, the compiler says to return 0. The digit 0 is considered a flag, it signals the compiler that there were no errors in the program, and that it can be terminated. However, if there are errors, the terminal will provide a long list of what seems like random words at first, but it is actually important information to fix the code.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Errors</h2>
         <p>
            There are two types of errors in programming, syntax errors and logical errors. The first type is usually easy to fix because the compiler usually catches it. This could happen when a programmer forgets the semicolon or forgets an operator. Logical errors on the other hand can be a little tricky. It's when the program still runs but it doesn't do the task it was supposed to do. Compilers can't find these errors, but a debugger can help find where the issue is at.
         </p>

         <h2>Before Going into Programming</h2>
         <p>
            Many people want to program right away. It's great to have those ambitions, but there are some prerequisites that will make the process easier. This section talks about how essential it is to know systems, terminals, and math.
         </p>
         <p>
            It is essential to navigate, use, and troubleshoot computers. For complete beginners, CompTIA A+ helps those who are new to their systems. It teaches about Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems - basically IT stuff that doesn't involve programming. It also teaches about the system's hardware and how to troubleshoot. It might take a while to read and comprehend, but it's well worth the time. Nothing is more embarrassing than a Computer Scientist who doesn't know how to update their drivers. Before looking for books, first visit the CompTIA website to find the most recent test versions that are supported. For example, the website states that test versions 1001/1002 are currently support, with 1101/1102 support coming in a couple of months. After finding the information needed, go to a retailer that provides the book for the CompTIA A+ exam; the book usually incorporates both test versions. For those who know about systems, the next step is learning how to use the terminal.
         </p>
         <p>
            The terminal appears to be a simple tool at first glance. Might be an empty window with no text, might show some text explaining how an update is needed. Whatever the case is, it's more complicated under the hood, and mastering it is important. It is highly recommended to read the Operating Systems lectures, but the next section will go into the fundamentals. Besides terminals, a computer scientist should have a solid foundation in math.
         </p>
         <p>
            An alarming amount of programming websites and YouTube tutorials don't show this, but math is heavily integrated in our programs. Anyone can program, but a Computer Scientist knows about time complexities and Big-O notation, all of which involves mathematics. It is possible to learn the first couple of lectures without knowing too much, but computer scientists are required to have a good understanding in calculus. Not to mention, they also need to learn about discreet mathematics, combinatorics, and linear algebra for the more complicated situations. Luckily, all of this will be mentioned in the math lectures of this website.
         </p>

         <h2>Preparing and Understanding the Terminal</h2>
         <p>
            In this section I assume that you have your terminal opened and are ready for the next instructions. This lecture will try to anticipate any issues, but for further assistance please search online. For now, we will be going over basic commands, updating the terminal, and installing the compiler. 
         </p>
         <h3>Commands</h3>
         <p>
            Before writing a program, this section will go over fundamental commands and how to traverse the directory. Consider a directory as tree-like collection of files, where each directory branches to subdirectories (files within files), and where the root of the tree is usually the storage location.
         </p>

         <h4>pwd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax"> 
            $ pwd
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/pwd_cmd.png" class="small"/> <br /> 
            Provides a path to the currently accessed directory. A path consist of a root directory, and all subsequent directories separated by a forward slash (/). Note, in Windows OS each step of the path is separated by a backslash (\). Remember this when referring to Linux or Windows, since getting the two mixed up can cause errors. 
         </p>

         <h4>ls Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ ls
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/ls_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Provides a preview of the subdirectories in the current directory.
         </p>

         <h4>cd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ cd directory_name <br />
            $ cd .. <br />
            $ cd <br />
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/cd_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Helps navigate the directory and can require additional input. For instance, to step into a subdirectory, type and enter the subdirectory's name after the cd command. To step back one directory, type two periods after the cd command. To step all the way back to the origin of the directory, enter cd by itself. Rather than using cd for every step, if the path of the desired directory is known, type the path after the command cd and then enter. Looking at the example, notice the path depicted in the green section, or notice the subdirectories when we enter the command ls.
         </p>

         <h4>mkdir Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ mkdir directory_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/mkdir_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Create a subdirectory in the current directory.
         </p>

         <h4>vim Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ vim file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/vim_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/cpp_file_instance.png" class="small align_right" />
            Creates and accesses the user defined C++ file. Note, these files have a (.cpp) extension which can be interpreted as “C Plus Plus”. Vim has modes and commands to edit, manipulate, save, and more. Typing right away will cause the first few characters from the keyboard to not register. To start writing/editing text, press the character (i) on the keyboard. This is known as insert mode, and is shown at the bottom of the window. To quit any of the several modes, press the escape key. Deleting characters while not in insert mode will cause the cursor to move to the left instead of deleting the letters. To fix this, hit the (i) key again.
         </p>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/set_nmbr_cmd.png" class="small align_left"/>
            Vim has unique commands that can be entered in the command line, located at the bottom of the window. Before typing a command, exit out of any mode. Each command starts with a colon (:). <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/override.png" class="small align_right"/>To know more about Vim, enter (:help) on the command line. This lecture will go over a few of the basic commands. To get line numbering, enter (:set number) in the command line. For saving files, type (:w) in the command line and press enter. To quit Vim and go back to the terminal, use the following command (:q). Note, if a file has been edited and the quit command is executed before saving, Vim will warn the user about unsaved changes. To bypass this enter the force quit command (:q!). Warning, all progress will be lost, so the better option is to use the save and quit command (:wq).
         </p>
         <p>   
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/saved_file.png" class="small align_left"/>
            Remember, Vim is an open-source editor. It comes with some distributors of Linux like Ubuntu, but if it's not installed, the terminal will complain and suggest installing it using whatever command it provides. Any editor can work with C++ files, but for educational purposes, this lecture will use Vim. 
         </p> 

         <h4>rmdir Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ rmdir directory_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/rmdir_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Removes a subdirectory in the current directory. Warning, only removes empty directories.
         </p>

         <h4>rm Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ rm file_name
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/rm_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Removes files that are in the current directory.
         </p>

         <h4>sudo Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ sudo ...
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/sudo_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            This command gives administrative access over operations. Any commands with sudo tagged onto it will initially ask for a password before doing its task, so make sure to remember the password. Knowing sudo, will allow users to update and install packages.
         </p>


         <h3>Updating</h3>
         <p>
            To avoid issues when installing the compiler check for updates. To do this, there are a set of instructions to follow. First, update the package list by entering the following command:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ sudo apt-get update
         </code>
         <p>
            The command "apt-get update" is part of the Advanced Package Tool (APT) that helps manage software. In this case, the command above is trying to get updates on the current packages to allow users to upgrade to the proper software. Packages is just another way to say applications or software. To upgrade, type the following in the terminal:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ sudo apt-get upgrade
         </code>
         <p>
            The last step ensures critical packages are upgraded, while it cleans up unnecessary packages. Type the following:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
         </code>
         <p>
            If successful, everything should be up to date. The next step is installing the compiler
         </p>

         <h3>Installing Compiler</h3>
         <p>
            The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is free software. More specifically, it's a compiler that supports multiple languages and is compatible with different types of hardware and operating systems. It has matured since its origin and has given us the GNU C++ Compiler, also known as g++, which allows us to compile both (.c) and (.cpp) files in terms of C++.
         </p>
         <p>
            There are two methods to download the package, but for this instance, use the build-essential route since it includes other key features like: libraries, debuggers, and the compiler itself. To do this, type the following:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ sudo apt install build-essential
         </code>
         <p>
            Afterwards, check to see if it is installed by entering:
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ g++ --version
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/C++/the_fundamentals_of_C++/gpp_version.png" class="medium" /> <br />
            If you see something like the image above, then the compiler has been successfully installed. The next step is to write a program. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Writing, Compiling, and Running Code</h2>
         <p>
            To begin, set up a user defined directory to store programs, in this case call it "Programs". 
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ mkdir Programs
         </code>
         <p>
            After creating a directory, access it with the cd command.
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ cd Programs
         </code>
         <p>
            Once inside, begin creating a program file. Use the vim command and call the file "HelloWorld.cpp".
         </p>
         <code class="example">
            $ vim HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Once the text editor opens, remember to hit the (i) key to begin insert mode. Type the Hello World <a href="#HelloWorld" class="lecture">example</a> from the beginning of the lecture. Once completed, save the file by getting out of insert mode and type the save quick command (:wq).
         </p>
         <p>
            After exiting the editor, begin compiling the file. Like the terminal and the editor, g++ has its own unique commands. The first step is to translate the (.cpp) file into an object file; it's a file with the extension (.o) attached to it. To clarify, the object file contains machine level code, which is something the system can understand. To start the process type:
         </p>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ g++ -c file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <code class="example">
            $ g++ -c HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Once the object file is created it will be in the current directory. Use command (ls) to view the new file. Notice how it has the same name as the C++ file, this is normal. At this point a syntax error may show instead of a file. The error's text will identify the location of the error in the form of text in the terminal. Simply go back and edit the file. If successful, the next step is to name and create an executable file. For C++, the executable file has a (.out) extension. This file will run and provide output from the program. Use the following example to create it:
         </p>
         <code class="syntax">
            $ g++ -o executable_file_name file_name.cpp
         </code>
         <code class="example">
            $ g++ -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp
         </code>
         <p>
            Typing the command (ls) will show the updated contents of the current directory. Notice how there is no extension with this file. To run it, use the dot-forward-slash (./) to denote the current directory with the name of the executable file attached ike so:

            Once submitted, the output will be displayed on the next line in the terminal. If it runs and there are issues with the output, then it is considered a logical error.
