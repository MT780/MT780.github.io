         <h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
         <p>
            If you already have your environment set up you may skip this
            section, otherwise keep reading. To write your own code
            you will need a text editor, which like the name states, is an 
            application that helps the user edit text. Luckily, all OS (Operating 
            Systems) come with one! For example, Windows has Notepad, MacOS 
            has TextEdit, and Linux usually has Vim. Now I say "usually" 
            since there are multiple distributors that preload the Linux OS 
            with there own choice of editor, but you will most likely encounter Vim, 
            especially if you use Ubuntu. There are also third party editors 
            that come with extra features. The one I am currently using is 
            Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. Make sure to find the one that is right for
            you, otherwise you may look at the Intro to Operating Systems
            lesson to learn how to use Vim. It's great to write your code somewhere, 
            but like all programers, you need a place to run it. That's where the 
            terminal comes in!
         </p>
         <p>
            The terminal is a nifty place that is the bridge between you
            and your computer. It is actually more complicated than that,
            but for now we will use this terminology to make it more
            digestible. For those who are using the MacOS or the Linux OS,
            you already have access to the terminal. As for Windows users
            we technically have Windows Powershell. Instead of using PowerShell,
            I highly recommend you to follow the installation and
            configuration guide for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Microsoft's 
            site, along with downloading Windows Terminal and Ubuntu from
            the Microsoft Store. What WSL does is partition a section of your computer
            for Linux, and is extremely useful. We are almost close to creating our environment,
            but we need one more thing.
         </p>
         <p>
            We have the terminal, now all we need are the tools
            to interpret our code; this is where compilers come in. A
            Compiler is software that takes our
            commands on the terminal, checks to see if everything is
            syntactically correct, and then runs our code. It is easy 
            to install one within the terminal, and I will show you in 
            the Intro to OS lecture.
         </p>
         <p>
            Remember how I said you need an editor and a terminal
            to write code, well that's not entirely true. There are applications
            known as IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)s that come with
            the same equipment that editors and terminals have, and then some.
            Almost all the big ones, like Microsoft's Visual Studio - not to
            get confused with Microsoft's Visual Studio Code which is just 
            the editor - are free to use, but come with a catch. Basically you
            can only use them for studying purposes, and can't make a profit
            unless you buy the business versions, while text editors and
            terminals are open source (FREE!) and you can do whatever you please.
            Companies like free, people like free, so it's best to follow
            the practices.
