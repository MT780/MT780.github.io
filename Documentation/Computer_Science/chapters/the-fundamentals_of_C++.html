         <h2>Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/Type_of_editors_on_windows.png" class="medium align_right" alt="" />
            If you already have your environment set up you may skip this
            section, otherwise keep reading. To write your own code
            you will need a text editor, which like the name states, is an 
            application that helps the user edit text. Luckily, all OS (Operating 
            Systems) come with one! For example, Windows has Notepad, MacOS 
            has TextEdit, and Linux usually has Vim. Now I say "usually" 
            since there are multiple distributors that preload the Linux OS 
            with there own choice of editor, but you will most likely encounter Vim, 
            especially if you use Ubuntu. There are also third party editors 
            that come with extra features. The one I am currently using is 
            Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. Make sure to find the one that is right for
            you, otherwise you may look at the Intro to Operating Systems
            lesson to learn how to use Vim. It's great to write your code somewhere, 
            but like all programs, you need to run it. That's where the 
            terminal comes in!
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/PowerShell_LinuxTerm_cmd.png" class="medium align_left"/>
            The terminal is a nifty place that is the bridge between you
            and your computer. It can take user input, run other programs,
            manage files, display output, and much more. For those 
            who are using the MacOS or the Linux OS,
            you already have access to the terminal. As for Windows users
            we have cmd (command-line) and Windows Powershell. Right now
            would be a good time to point out the controversies behind the 
            naming scheme and their definitions. There is a difference between,
            terminal, shell, and command-line, though they act so similarly 
            that most people often interchange the names. For the sake of uniformity,
            we will use Linux terminal to write, compile, and run our programs.
            I highly recommend Window users to follow the installation and
            configuration guide for WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on Microsoft's 
            site. What WSL does is partition a section of your computer
            for Linux, and is extremely useful. If you don't want to
            install WSL, you can still use cmd and Notepad to write,
            compile, and run your code. We are almost close to 
            creating our environment, but we need one more thing.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            We have the terminal, now all we need are the tools
            to interpret our code. A
            Compiler is software that translates our high-level language,
            in this case C++, into low level language, which is machine 
            code. It is easy to install one within the terminal, and I will show you in 
            the Intro to OS lecture.
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/Visual_Studio_pic.png" class="medium align_right"/>
            Remember how I said you need an editor and a terminal
            to write code, well that's not entirely true. There are applications
            known as IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)s that come with
            the same equipment that editors and terminals have, and then some.
            Almost all the big ones, like Microsoft's Visual Studio - not to
            get confused with Microsoft's Visual Studio Code which is just 
            the editor - are free to use, but come with a catch. Basically you
            can only use them for studying purposes, and can't make a profit
            unless you buy the business versions, while text editors and
            terminals are open source (FREE!) and you can do whatever you please.
            Companies like free, people like free, so it's best to follow
            the practices.

         <h2>The Basic Structure Of Any Code</h2>
         <code class="example">
            1 #include &lt;iostream&gt; <br />
            2 using namespace std; <br />
            3 <br />
            4 int main() <br />
            5 {<br />
            6 cout << "Hello World!"\n;<br />
            7 return 0;<br />
            8 }<br />
         </code>
         <h3>Reading each line of code</h3>
         <p>
            C++ is case-sensitive, for example, the key
            term return is different from the word Return. It also has a
            free-form layout, so space and line breaks are ignored during
            compilation. I know what you're thinking, if that's the case
            why can't I write, for example, "s t d" instead of "std" well
            the compiler ignores the spaces not the key words. Still, you
            can write each symbol, keyword, integer, and string - when we
            mean string we're saying a collection of characters - on 
            their own line and it will still compile like the code above. 
            The code above consist of multiple statements that we will 
            examine.
         </p>
         <h4>#include iostream;</h4>
         <p>
            On line 1 there is the #include directive, which tells the
            compiler to look at the contents of the iostream file that is 
            within the less-than sign and greater-than sign. You will learn more about 
            the file in the string manipulation section.
         </p>
         <h4>using namespace std;</h4>
         <p>
            Line 2 tells the compiler to use the default name space to
            identify terms such as cout; cout is part of the iostream 
            file. As you will learn, you can 
            override the functionality of key terms in your
            program by calling a different name space, but since we're learning, 
            we will use the standard.
         </p>
         <h4>int main()</h4>
         <p>
            Let's look at the following statement on line 4, main() is a
            function for the program. Every program has a main function,
            and can have additional functions. Notice the parenthesis,
            here we can provide additional information that the 
            function might need, though since this is a simple program we
            can just leave it empty. You will learn more about this in
            future sections. The keyword int is called a data type, this specific data 
            type says that the main function can return an integer.
         </p>
         <h4>{ ... }</h4>
         <p>
            Both lines 5 and 8 help identify where the content of the
            main function begins and ends.
         </p>
         <h4>cout << "Hello World!"\n;</h4>
         <p>
            In order to send output to the terminal, you need the
            term cout, followed by the operator <<. The part "Hello 
            World!" is considered a string and is defined by the
            quotation marks "" surrounding the characters. This helps
            the compiler distinguish code from plain text. The 
            escape sequence \n is considered one character to the
            compiler, and it tells the compiler to break and start on
            a new line in the terminal. The semicolon is like a period,
            and symbolizes the end of a statement. 
         </p>
         <h4>return 0;</h4>
         <p>
            Remember how I said the main function expects an integer to be returned,
            well this is it. On line 7 the compiler says to return 0,
            this means that there were no errors in the program and that it 
            can be terminated. However, if there are errors, the terminal
            will give you a long list of what seems like random words at first,
            but it is actually important information for fixing your code.  
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Errors</h2>
         <p>
            There are two types of errors in programming, syntax
            errors and logical errors. The first type is usually
            easy to fix because the compiler usually catches it
            for you. This could happen when you accidentally
            forget the semicolon or forget an operator. logical
            errors on the other hand can be a little tricky.
            It's when the program still runs, but it doesn't do 
            what you ask it to. Compilers can't find these errors,
            but a debugger can help you go step by step till you
            find where you went wrong. 
         </p>

         <h2>Before Going Into Programming</h2>
         <p>
            You probably want to run your first program right away. 
            That's great, and I want you to keep that ambition, but 
            there are some prerequisites that you should complete 
            first before diving in. Not to say that you can't program 
            right away, humans are smart and can adapt, but it helps 
            when you know the fundamentals. Overall, this section 
            gives you a couple of pointers on where to start, and 
            also a quick guide towards writing, compiling, and 
            running your first program.
         </p>
         <p>
            First you must know how to navigate, use, and 
            troubleshoot the computer. If you're a complete 
            beginner when it comes to computers, then I highly
             recommend getting a book that's for the CompTIA A+ exam. 
             It teaches you about Windows, Linux, and MAC operating 
             systems - basically IT stuff that doesn't involve 
             programming. It also teaches you about the system's 
             hardware and how to troubleshoot. It might take a while 
             to read and comprehend, but it's well worth the time. 
             Nothing is more embarrassing than a Computer Scientist 
             who doesn't know how to update their drivers. Before 
             looking for books, first visit the CompTIA website. 
             There you can find the recent version for the CompTIA A+ 
             exam - currently we're on tests 1001 and 1002, with 1101 
             and 1102 on the horizon. Notice how the test is split up 
             into two (one's for troubleshooting software and the 
             other is hardware), don't get discouraged it's basically 
             a two in one situation. After that you can go to Amazon 
             or some other retailer that provides a book. If you 
             already know how to use your system, the next thing is 
             the terminal.
         </p>
         <p>
            The terminal appears to be a simple tool at first glance. 
            Might be an empty window with no text, might show some 
            text explaining that you need to update. Whatever the case 
            is, it's more complicated under the hood, and mastering it 
            is the best thing you can ever do. I highly recommend you 
            reading the Operating Systems section, but once again, you 
            can probably get by just knowing the fundamentals. Besides 
            terminals, a computer scientist should have a solid 
            foundation in math. 
         </p>
         <p>
            An alarming amount of programming websites and YouTube 
            tutorials don't show this, but you need to have a solid 
            foundation in math. Anyone can program, but a Computer 
            Scientist knows about time complexities and Big-O notation, 
            all of which involves mathematics. You can probably get away 
            with a couple of sections in these lectures without knowing 
            too much, but you need at least a solid foundation in 
            calculus. Not to mention that you also need to learn about 
            discreet mathematics and combinatorics for the more 
            complicated situations. Luckily all of this will be 
            mentioned in the math section of this website. You're 
            probably tired of hearing the word math, good thing we're 
            finally going to program. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <h2>Writing, Compiling, and running Code</h2>
         <p>
            In this section I assume that you have your terminal 
            opened and are ready for the next instructions. If you seem 
            to be having difficulties at any point, please refer to the 
            internet since I cannot anticipate every issue. For now, we 
            will be going over basic commands, updating the terminal, 
            installing the compiler by getting the build-essential 
            package, creating a directory, 
            creating a C++ file, compiling that file, and running that 
            file in that order. 
         </p>
         <h3>Commands</h3>
         <p>
            Before writing our program it's essential to know how to 
            navigate our terminal. In this section we will be going 
            over fundamental commands. If you wish to know more visit
            the operating systems section, or research it online.
         </p>

         <h4>pwd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax"> 
            ~$ pwd
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/pwd_cmd.png" class="small"/> <br /> 
            Notifies you which directory you're currently on.
         </p>

         <h4>ls Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ ls
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/ls_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Provides a preview of the subdirectories in the current directory you're in.
         </p>

         <h4>cd Command</h4>
         <code class="syntax">
            ~$ cd directory_name <br />
            ~$ cd .. <br />
            ~$ cd <br />
         </code>
         <p>
            <img src="../../../images/cd_cmd.png" class="small" /> <br />
            Helps navigate the directory. Can require additional
            input, for instance, if you want to move into a subdirectory 
            then you type and enter the subdirectory's name after the cd
            command. If you want to go back one directory you simply type two periods 
            after the cd command. Note, if you know the location of a 
            directory you want to visit, then chain together a mixture
            of the two periods (..) and directory names with 
            multiple forward slashes (/) between each one. Looking at the
            example, notice the location depicted
            in the green section, or notice the subdirectories
            when we enter the command ls.
